### Credits to Sebastian Lague
Hello, I hope you enjoy looking at this project.</br>
This started from following a fantastic youtube tutorial.</br>
The channel that created the tutorial is called Sebastian Lague.</br>
Here is a link to their video</br>

### What I learned
The tutorial itself taught me a lot of skills and tricks that can be used within Unity</br>
Not only that but I was able to implement an AI algorithm using weights and wants</br>

After following the tutorial I wanted to test my knowledge a little more</br>
I decided to create a second variation of boid.</br>
These boids prefer to fly alone and actively avoid other boids of the same type</br>
Here you can see the blue boids flying in massive flocks while the red boids are much more sparse.</br>
