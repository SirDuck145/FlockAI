Hello,
I hope you enjoy looking at this project.
This started from following a fantastic youtube tutorial. 
The channel that created the tutorial is called Sebastian Lague.

After following the tutorial I wanted to test my knowledge a little more
I am currently working on implementing a prey boid, and turning the current boid into hunters.
Hopefully I can create a neat game of tag... and feasting.
